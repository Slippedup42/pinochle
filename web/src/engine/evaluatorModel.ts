// GENERATED FILE — do not edit by hand.
//
// Produced by `export_evaluator.py` (issue #114) from `rollout_evaluator.json`, which
// `fit_evaluator.py` and `generate_rollout_dataset.py` write (issues #113, #112).
// Re-run the exporter after any refit; `test_export_evaluator.py` fails the Python
// suite if this file has drifted from the model it claims to carry.

// The distilled bidding AI, as data.
//
// Epic #104's shipped AI was three guessed constants (`OPENER_THRESHOLD = 320`,
// `DEFENSIVE_PUSH_FLOOR = 200`, `MELD_ONLY_TRICK_ESTIMATE = 60`). These weights
// replace the first two with numbers fitted to what a 150-sample Monte Carlo
// rollout actually decided in 2000 real decision points.
//
// Two models, and they are NOT interchangeable. `BID_MODEL` answers "does taking
// this contract beat defending it", from a 12-card hand with both melds unknown
// and an auction still running. `FOLD_MODEL` answers "does playing this contract
// out beat conceding it", from a different 12-card hand — post-pass, both melds
// face up, auction over. They are fitted on disjoint row sets with different
// feature lists; feeding one the other's features is meaningless, not merely
// inaccurate.
//
// Weights are in RAW feature units. The decision is
// `sum(weight[i] * feature[i]) + intercept >= 0` (equivalently
// `sigmoid(...) >= threshold`) with no scaling step to reproduce — the
// standardisation `fit_evaluator.py` fits under is unwound before export
// precisely so this file needs no companion mean/stddev vector.

// Provenance, copied from the artefact so a reader of this file can tell what
// configuration the weights describe without opening the Python side. A model
// fitted against a strategy flag that has since flipped is worse than no model.
//
// GeneralStrategy skill 5, as configured in pinochle_engine.py:

//   fold_samples         50

//   live bid path        choose_bid_vs_defence (bid_ev_differential vs defend_ev, 20 samples)
